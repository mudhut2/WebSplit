What is WebSplit:

    The Goal is for WebSplit to be a fully functional timer splitting application with accurate timing to the frame for speedruns. This includes 
    the ability to load/compare times and store these on the web for access anywhere. Achieving frame-perfect timing in a web application is tricky because of JavaScripts single-threaded nature (it can only do one action at a time and must wait for processes to complete). I am slowly figuring out how to negate this major drawback
    but for now the timing remains inconsistent in a speedrun context.
